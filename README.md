# admin-dashboard
An admin dashboard page for a website.

## Plan
- Does my program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have?

  - The user interface will be an administrator dashboard for some website. There interface will have no functionality. There will only be a layout implemented with HTML and CSS.

- What inputs will my program have? Will the user enter data or will I get input from somewhere else?

  - There will be no user input due the interface having no functionality.

- What's the desired output?

  - Despite there being no user input, the desired output would be the completed admin dashboard.

- Given my inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?

  - There are no inputs, but the desired output would require finishing the HTML and CSS code.
